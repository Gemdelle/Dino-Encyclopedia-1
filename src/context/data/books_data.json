A keratinous beak prepped shoots before occlusion, while molariform teeth ground plant matter. A capacious gut with fermentation chambers maximized nutrient extraction. Foraging was slow and deliberate, with sweeping movements of the snout across ground cover. The tail club was likely held aloft during feeding to deter ambush predators.

When disturbed by predators it adopted a defensive stance, raising its armored osteoderms and swinging its massive tail club in forceful lateral arcs. Trackway evidence indicates limited gregariousness, suggesting that individuals rarely moved in coordinated groups. Osteoderm patterns and club morphology may have served intraspecific display or recognition. Bone histology and tooth microwear imply crepuscular feeding cycles, reducing midday heat stress. Low-frequency bellows likely mediated long-distance communication, while tactile signaling among proximate individuals reinforced social bonds. Periodic movements between habitats remain hypothetical, inferred from isotopic variation in fossils. Resting was sedentary with individuals using thick cover for concealment and energy conservation.",

Monsoon onset improved hatchling resource use.\n\nFossilized clutches attributed to Brachiosaurus display egg arrangement patterns consistent with philopatric nesting, suggesting repeated returns to ancestral sites. Sedimentological context indicates rapid burial events that preserved embryonic remains, enabling isotopic analysis of fluid exchange. Such evidence enhances understanding of sauropod reproductive strategies and paleoenvironmental adaptations. Rare isotopic data emerges."
